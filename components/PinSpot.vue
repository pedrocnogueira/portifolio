          PinSpot is an app designed and developed to compile all the places you
          find on social media in a practical way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using AI, the app extracts the core information of Reels and TikToks,
          such as the place's name, description, and address, and displays it in
          a simple and searchable format.
        </p>
        <p>
          As one of the founders of the project, I was responsible for
          implementing most of the app's interface and database.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since its release in the App Store, in September 2024, PinSpot has
          achieved almost 3k impressions and 178 downloads.
